# Study-Of-Disease-Spread-in-BITS-Goa
Using agent-based simulations to understand how an infection spreads in a college campus
## Problem Statement
Understanding the spread of an infection will help in planning efficient rules and regulations for managing and preventing outbreak and provide insight into predicting the future of the outbreaks.
(aims: to be added)
## Methodology and Implementation
### GIS Data
GIS data is collected using Open Street Map and GQIS tools. A Vector Polygon dataset represents the boundary of the campus. Vector point data is used to represent different locations like student hostels, mess and classrooms. 
### Model
The agents in the model represent student. Students can move within the boundary of the campus, go to different locations and expose or infect other people to disease.
The model's environment mimics the everyday lives of students in the campus. Students stay in the hostel. They attend classes according to their timetables and go to mess, eateries or other activities.
The model uses the S-E-I-R-D Framework (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered â€“ Deceased) to demonstrate the disease progression in individual agents. Each person in the simulation has a variable which tracks the stage of disease progression.
### Implementation
Different datasets contain details of students and class location. stored as CSV files

ID.csv : List of Students, their hostel, batch and branches.

merged_timetable.csv : Acts as a master timetable. 4 columns: unique_ID,day, hour and location. Used to store details of all lectures according to the day of the week, hour of the day and location of the lecture/class. each <day,hour,location> triplet has a unique id which is used to reference the triplet

Student.csv: 2 columns: student_id, unique_id. This csv contains unique_ids of all lectures for each student in the simulation.

For each day and hour in the simulation, filter rows in merged_timetable.csv containing the current hour and day. The unique ids of these rows represent lectures during that hour.
For each filtered unique id: each unique id represents a particular lecture. We can get location of the lecture using the row of the unique id. Using Student.csv, locations of all students who have the filtered unique_ids mentioned are updated according to the corresponding location. This ensures students attend classes according to their lectures.

Students who don't have a class in the current hour and day go to a default location (eg. hostel). 

Platform: The model is developed using NetLogo 6.2.0 with GIS extension (version 1.1.2). The BehaviorSpace tool in NetLogo is used to run experiments. Each experiment runs multiple simulations with varying number of vehicles and generates CSV files containing results for each simulation. Python (Matplotlib library) is used to analyse data and visualise results.
